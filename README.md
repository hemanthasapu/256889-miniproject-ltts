## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Dynamic memory allocation of 2D arrays
2. The calculation of various matrix operations
3. Executable file crashing because of segmentation fault
4. All of them have been overcome by peer help and searching for resources which showed the proper syntax for dynamic memory allocation.
